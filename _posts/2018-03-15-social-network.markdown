title: '"Introduction to Social Network Analysis with R" by Fatemeh Salehian Kia'
text: >
    Social Network Analysis is to visualize and analyze data from 
    a social network like Twitter or Facebook. If you're involved 
    in analytics in any capacity, this course will be a huge help, 
    teaching you how the R SNA and igraph modules works and how to 
    format data for analysis, create graphs, analyze network graphs, 
    and visualize networks.
    Basic knowledge of R programming, but no knowledge of social 
    network analysis required.
