title: '"Software Engineering for Research Students: How to organize and document your research software project" by Chris Kerslake'
text: In this hands-on workshop we will restructure and document an existing Python software project and its code to make it more readable, easier to share with others and easier to hand-off to the next researcher. We will cover how to comment and document your code, organize your project, add logging, add configuration files and add verification and testing mechanisms. The sample project, both before and after, and all examples will be available for download before and after the class.
