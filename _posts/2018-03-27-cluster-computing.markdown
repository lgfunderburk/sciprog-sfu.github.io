      This is an introductory workshop on how to use Cedar to run simple jobs. We will review how to
      login to Cedar, what the Login, Interactive, and Compute nodes are; the differences between
      scratch, project, and home directories; how to submit a batch job; how to monitor your submitted
      job; and how to install R packages in your home directory.
