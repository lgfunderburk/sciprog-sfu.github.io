title: '"Deep learning with Caffe" by Apala Guha'
text: "Deep learning has emerged has one of the most important applications in the word today, image classification being one of its primary uses. Image classification is used in robotics, autonomous vehicles, IOT devices etc. In this workshop we will learn the basic principles underlying deep learning networks, how they are implemented, and, how to visualize a trained network. We will use Caffe, which is a popular deep learning tool and apply it to an image database."
