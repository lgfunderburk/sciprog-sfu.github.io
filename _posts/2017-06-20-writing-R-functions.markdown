title: '"Writing Functions in R" by Michelle Jones'
text: "Come learn the basics of writing functions in R. Functions are a valuable tool that can be used to perform sensitivity analyses, simulate data, or set up parallel processing for complex-analyses, such as state-space models. In this introduction we will cover the basics by first building a function for a simple deterministic population-dynamic model, and then modifying it to produce random data sets."
