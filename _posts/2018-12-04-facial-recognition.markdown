title: '"Eigenface Facial Recognition" by Alice Roberts and Kristen Bystrom'
text: >
      In this workshop participants will learn about human facial recognition and use MATLAB to explore which faces in a database are similar to theirs. We will introduce EigenFaces and the mathematics used to compute facial similarity including principal component analysis and singular value decomposition.
