title: '"Introduction to Deep Learning Using Tensorflow and Keras" by Nafiseh Sedaghat'
text: In this workshop I provide a case study of developing deep learning neural network model with Python in Google Colaboratory or Colab. I will show how to use Tensorflow and Keras to create a very simple deep neural net. It requires no setup and runs fully in cloud. It does not matter whether you are using a Mac or a Windows computer, having a google account to sign in to Google is enough.
