title: '"Develop narratives with your R code using R Markdown" by Bruno Grande'
text: "You may have heard of the term literate programming. It's actually been around since 1984 when it was coined by Donald Knuth. Essentially, the idea of literate programming is the interweaving of code and documentation. R Markdown goes one step further and incorporates the output of your code such as figures and tables, allowing you to develop a narrative for your analysis. You can now generate fully reproducible high-quality reports of your analyses and easily share them with others. This workshop will introduce how to get started with incorporating R Markdown into your workflow."
