title: '"Using yt for analysis and visualization of volumetric data in Python" by Alex Razoumov'
text: >
      In this workshop we will take a look at yt, a Python package for analyzing multi-resolution volumetric and particle data. Initially written for working with astrophysical simulation data, yt is now widely used across many disciplines dealing with 3D simulation or observational/experimental data. We will also look at using yt for data analysis and manipulation, including creating isosurfaces and streamlines and subsetting data in many different ways.
