title: '"Analytics: Querying Data with SQL" by Fatemeh Salehian Kia'
text: We live in a data-driven world: people search through data to find insights to inform their decisions. The skill is helpful not only for data scientists but for almost everyone. In this workshop, you will learn how to communicate with relational databases through SQL. You will learn -- and practice with hands-on exercises -- how to manipulate data and build queries that communicate with more than one table.
