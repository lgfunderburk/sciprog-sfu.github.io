text: "Emacs is a powerful, extensible and highly customizable text editor. It can do anything that can be done with plain text: write and run code, literate programming, version control, writing your papers and thesis, organizing your agenda and notes, emails, etc. The idea behind this workshop is to get you started on your emacs journey so that you can more easy look for information and build up the knowledge yourself."
