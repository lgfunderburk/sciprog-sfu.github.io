title: '"Correcting P-Values in R" by Laura Gutierrez Funderburk'
text: In this workshop we will be going over the unfortunate phenomenon of misreported p-values in social science, mainly psychology, and how we can use the R package "Statcheck" to autorecalculate p-values in the publications we come across and in our own work. A small but valuable tool, this package allows us to streamline the process of increasing the reproducibility of our statistical analyses and increase our confidence. This workshop is aimed at complete beginners and assumes no previous coding or R knowledge. However, an understanding of what p-values are and why reproducibility in social sciences is an issue.
