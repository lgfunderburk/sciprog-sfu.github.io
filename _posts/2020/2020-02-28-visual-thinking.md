title: '"Analysis with Visualizations and Visual Thinking" by Stanislaw Nowak'
text: Data visualization surrounds us. In the workplace, in popular media, and even in personal computing devices such as fitness trackers, we take advantage of visual aids to better understand data and the world they represent. This introductory workshop discusses the cognitive and perceptual processes that enable data visualizations to be effective analysis tools and provides practical hands-on guidance for visualization design.
