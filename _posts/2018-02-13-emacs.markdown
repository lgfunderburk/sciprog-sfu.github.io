title: '"Getting started with emacs" by Marie-Hélène Burle'
text: >
    Emacs is a powerful extensible and highly customizable text editor. 
    While you do not need any prior knowledge of emacs, this workshop 
    will be most useful if you have some level of familiarity with some 
    of these languages or system\: R, RMarkdown and git. Not only will it 
    help understanding what we are doing, it will also give you an opportunity 
    to see how one can do some of the tasks you are familiar with differently. 
    Even if you end up not embracing emacs, it could broaden your perspective 
    on some of the tasks and tools of your workflow. That said, anybody curious 
    about emacs is welcome! You can always learn something new, even if you 
    don't follow everything on your machine.
