title: '"Sentiment Analysis for Amazon Product Reviews" by Apala Guha'
text: "Websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, IMDB carry a wealth of information in the form of Tweets, comments, and, reviews. Sentiment analysis aims to extract the sentiment from such natural language constructs. In this workshop we will be exploring building a machine learning pipeline for sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews. We will be touching on text preprocessing, feature vector formation using hashing as well as neural networks, and regression model training."
