title: '"Heatmaps in R" by Lisa N. Cao'
text: >
      In this workshop we will be going over how to generate Heatmaps, a type of visualization popular for describing high-dimensional datasets (such as genomic or spatial) through the use of colour grids. Participants will learn how to generate these maps using the heatmap() function in base R, and interactive heatmaps using the package heatmaply, which works on top of ggplot2. This workshop will be geared towards beginners.
      Participants are encouraged to come in with a basic knowledge of R functions and syntax structure, as well as some basic graphical knowledge including hex colour codes. Because this workshop will be made to be as accessible as possible, I highly encourage tentative participants to come anyways.
