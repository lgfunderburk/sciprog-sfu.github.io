title: 'Q&A Session'
text: "Fact: We can achieve more together through peer-to-peer assistance and collaboration than individually. Come work on your own coding projects in a supportive environment to get (and give) help from your peers! Sometimes, it's a matter of sharing software tools that will make each other's lives easier. Other times, it's finding the right solution online to resolve that annoying error message you keep running into. In all cases, we can learn from each other during these Q&A sessions."
