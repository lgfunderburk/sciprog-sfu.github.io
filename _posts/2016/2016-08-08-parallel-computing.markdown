title: '"Parallel Computing" by Alex Razoumov'
text: "Join us for a beginner-level introduction to MPI (Message Passing Interface), an industry standard library for distributed-memory parallel computing on large systems. There are implementations of MPI for all major compiled and interpreted languages, including C/C++, Python, and R, and it's a default parallel computing library on all academic HPC systems, including the Compute Canada clusters. Using a simple example, we will learn how to partition your calculation on multiple processors, and how to use basic send/receive and broadcast commands."
