title: '"Supercharge your plotting in R using ggplot2" by Bruno Grande'
text: "There are several approaches to plotting available in R: base graphics, lattice and ggplot2, just to name
a few. In recent years, ggplot2 has truly taken off to become one of the most popular visualization
packages in R. It leverages the grammar of graphics to deliver an intuitive framework to build plots and
other graphics. This workshop will cover the basics of plotting in R using ggplot2 We will learn how to
build scatterplots, strip plots, barplots, histograms and other density plots. We will also touch upon
various customizations for polishing your plots and preparing them to be published. I will assume that
attendees are familiar with R. Please read the installation instructions ahead of the workshop."
