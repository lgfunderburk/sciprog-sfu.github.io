title: 'Become a master manipulator... of data with dplyr! with Thea Van Rossum'
text: "Learn the dplyr methods of your dreams to slice, stir and squash your way from big ol' data.frame to the just the answers to all your questions.Plus! We'll put commands together using pipes! Ever wonder about that %>% symbol? Wonder no more!
Piping isn't just for cake icing or Super Mario's preferred mode of transport. It's your ticket away from brow-furrowing lines of code like: sqrt(sum(abs(x)))."
