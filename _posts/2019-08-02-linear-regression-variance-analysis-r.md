title: '"Linear regression and analysis of variance using R" by Laura Gutierrez Funderburk'
text: >
      In this workshop participants will have an opportunity to perform linear regression and analysis of variance on various datasets and explore the model that best fits the data. Participants will learn about linear, multi linear and polynomial models and determine what model fits best the data they are exploring. Participants will also have an opportunity to learn about one-way and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on datasets and problems provided during the workshop.
