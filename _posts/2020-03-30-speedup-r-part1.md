title: '"Let's Make Your R Code FastR: Part 1" by Nikola Surjanovic'
text: This workshop serves as an introduction to writing faster R code. We will discuss important concepts such as vectorization and how to identify what parts of the code might be slowing you down. If time permits, we will go over a bit of parallel computing in R and how to use the Rcpp package (main topics from part 2 of the workshop).
