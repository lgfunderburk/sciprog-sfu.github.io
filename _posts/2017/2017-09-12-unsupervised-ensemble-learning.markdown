title: '"Unsupervised Ensemble Learning" by Dustin Johnson'
text: "Unsupervised learning involves determining a hidden structure (typically groupings or clusters) from unlabelled data. Without labels, we don't have a measure of accuracy to determine which model to trust more. In this workshop, we will demonstrate how more minds work better than one and let a consensus of experts decide the ideal clustering."
