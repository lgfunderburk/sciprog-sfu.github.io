title: '"Data Cleaning Using R" by Nafiseh Sedagha'
text: "It is said that cleaning/cleansing data takes 80% of data analysis process. Data cleaning must be repeated for every new data in every project. Typically, data sets obtained from a real world problems violate the standards of clean data in different ways and analyzing data without cleaning is impossible. In the process of cleaning data, we try to remove every possible problem in data and organize the values in a standard manner."
