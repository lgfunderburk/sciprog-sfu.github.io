title: '"Machine Learning with Python: An Introduction to classification methods with scikit-learn" by Lee Sutton'
text: "In this introductory workshop we will look at machine learning with Python using the scikit-learn library. You will build your first classification models using naive bayes, support vector machines, and logistic regression. You will learn how to fine-tune your models and what you need to consider when training your model."
