title: '"Applications of Regular Expressions" by Bruno Grande'
text: "In a past workshop, I introduced regular expressions as a powerful tool for searching, parsing and extracting virtually anything from free-form text. In this workshop, we will go one step further and explore various applications of regular expressions. We will focus on tools that are readily available to everyone, namely the command-line utilities grep, sed and awk."
