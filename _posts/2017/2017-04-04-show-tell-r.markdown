title: 'Show & Tell on R'
text: "Do you know something cool about R? Is there an R package that consistently makes your life better? Show & Tells are meant to be a casual venue for demoing cool tricks that you've learned over the years. Passing that hard-earned knowledge to the next generation will hopefully accelerate research, or at least make it a bit more pleasant for the rest of us."
