title: '"A taste of parallel programming with Chapel" by Alex Razoumov'
text: >
      Chapel is a relatively new high-level programming language for shared- and distributed-memory machines. It combines the ease-of-use of Python and the speed of C++ and is the perfect language to learn the basics of parallel programming, whether you are trying to accelerate your computation on a multi-core laptop or on an HPC cluster. In this one-hour hands-on introduction I will go over several of Chapel's high-level abstractions.
