title: '"Scientific visualization with Plotly" by Alex Razoumov'

      In this one-hour workshop we will take a look at using Plot.ly open-source Python library for scientific visualization. We will start with simple 2D plots, create some interactive geographical maps, and then will move to more advanced 3D plotting and animations in a web browser.
