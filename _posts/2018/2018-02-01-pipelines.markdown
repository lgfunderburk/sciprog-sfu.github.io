title: '"Building robust data processing pipelines with Python and Shell Scripts" by Sean La'
text: >
    Practical scientific computing involves extensive manipulation and 
    processing of data. A pipeline is a self-contained program that 
    performs a series of data processing steps with very little effort 
    needed from the user. An ideal scientific computing pipeline is one 
    that requires the user to only provide input data files and performs 
    the rest of the computation on its own. Building pipelines like 
    these are ideal for scientific research because they allow others 
    to easily replicate computational research. In this workshop, 
    participants will learn the basics of creating robust data processing 
    pipelines using shell scripts and Python. Participants will build 
    their own genetic variant caller pipeline to showcase this skill.
